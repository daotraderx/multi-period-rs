Multi Period Relative Strength

Introduction
The Multi Period Relative Strength indicator is a powerful tool designed to help traders and investors compare a stock's performance against a benchmark (typically SPY) over various time periods. Modified from RS Rating created by @Fred6724
What is Relative Strength?
Relative Strength (RS) measures how well a stock is performing compared to a benchmark index. It's calculated as:
RS = (1 + Stock Performance) / (1 + Benchmark Performance)

Where:
RS > 1: Stock is outperforming the benchmark
RS = 1: Stock is performing exactly the same as the benchmark
RS < 1: Stock is underperforming the benchmark
For example, if your stock gained 10% while SPY gained 5%, the RS would be (1 + 0.10) / (1 + 0.05) = 1.10 / 1.05 = 1.048, indicating outperformance.

Features
This indicator analyzes relative strength across four key time periods:

Weekly RS (5 days): Short-term relative strength
Monthly RS (22 days): Medium-term relative strength
Quarterly RS (63 days): Longer-term relative strength
Yearly RS (Weighted Average): A weighted average of 3, 6, 9, and 12-month performances (with weights of 40%, 20%, 20%, and 20% respectively)
Each time period can be toggled on/off, and line colors are customizable.

How to Use
Apply the indicator to any stock chart
The indicator appears in a separate panel below the price chart
The horizontal dashed line at 1.0 marks the divide between outperformance (above) and underperformance (below)
The table in the top-right corner shows exact values and performance status
Toggle different time periods on/off using the settings
Interpretation
Rising RS Lines: The stock is gaining strength against the benchmark
Falling RS Lines: The stock is losing strength against the benchmark
Crossing Above 1.0: The stock has shifted from underperforming to outperforming
Crossing Below 1.0: The stock has shifted from outperforming to underperforming
Divergence Between Periods: May indicate changing strength/weakness dynamics
Applications
Stock Selection: Focus on stocks with RS > 1 (outperformers)
Sector Rotation: Identify which sectors are strengthening or weakening
Exit Signals: Consider selling when RS falls below 1.0
Strength Confirmation: Use alongside other indicators to confirm trend strength
Relative Performance: Compare multiple stocks against each other by analyzing their RS values
Settings
Comparative Symbol: Change the benchmark (default is SPY)
Show/Hide Period Lines: Toggle each time period on/off
Custom Colors: Change colors for each line
